# Image segmentation on colorectal tissue for tumor detection

* implementation of the original [UNET architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf)

* the trained model performs followingly after ~50 epochs
where the first column shows the original image, the second shows the binary masks that annotates cancerous tissue and the last column shows the binary mask generated by the model, brighter spots representing higher probabilities for cancer
